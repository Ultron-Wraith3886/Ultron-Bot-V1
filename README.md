# **Ultron V1**
> *Discord Bot if you didn't know*

## Origin
> #### I recently started developing this discord bot for testing my python skills (probably...) and also because I liked the Fictional Character named ["Ultron"](https://www.marvel.com/characters/ultron), if you don't know him even after he became famous in ["What If..."](marvel.com/tv-shows/animation/what-if/1), he is basically a machine created by Dr. Henry "Hank" Pym (Tony Stark in the MCU) and then later he became a SuperVillain with cool abilities. 

## About
> #### Ultron is currently a small bot with some features including Moderation (Channel, Kick-Ban, Mute, Member), Web Scraping and the Overuse of APIs (Animal Images and Facts) and a bit of fun being added. **This bot was built with [_Nextcord_](https://github.com/nextcord/nextcord)** and [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)). 

## Status
> #### Currently Hosted on [Replit.com](https://replit.com/@xyzabc10) and has i-dont-know-how-many commands.
